# PHP Markdown to TCPDF Library

This PHP library allows you to insert Markdown text directly into a TCPDF document. It provides extensive control over page breaks and the exact placement of content within a page.

Main features:
- Insert Markdown text into TCPDF documents
- Control over pages and page areas
- Optional conversion of Markdown to HTML (primarily for parser testing)

This library makes generating PDF documents from Markdown content easier, more flexible, and efficient. Perfect for projects where documents need to be dynamically generated from Markdown sources.
